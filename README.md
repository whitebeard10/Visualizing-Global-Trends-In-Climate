This web application is designed to help users visualize global trends in climate change using interactive data visualizations. The project includes various charts, graphs, and maps that display climate-related data, including temperature changes, deforestation rates, seasonal variations, CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas concentrations, global threats to biodiversity, heat content anomalies, and hierarchical data visualization.

## Features

- **Annual Surface Temperature Change**: Visualizes mean surface temperature changes from 1961 to 2021 for selected countries.

- **Annual Deforestation**: Displays deforestation rates by year on a world map, allowing users to explore deforestation trends over time.

- **Seasonal Temperature Change**: Provides insights into seasonal temperature variations over the years.

- **CO2 Emissions per Capita**: Compares CO2 emissions per capita in 1956 and 2021 for different countries.

- **Global Threats to Biodiversity**: Shows the distribution of threats to biodiversity through a pie chart.

- **Heat Content Anomaly**: Visualizes heat content anomalies over time with the ability to update the chart.

- **Greenhouse Gas Data**: Displays the concentration of various greenhouse gases over time, with an option to select the gas of interest.

- **Hierarchical Visualization**: Presents a hierarchical visualization of climate data categories, subcategories, and levels.
